/**
 * Finally, there is a function that lets you produce sequence elements one by one or by chunks of arbitrary sizes â€“
 * the sequence() function. This function takes a lambda expression containing calls of yield() and yieldAll() functions.
 * They return an element to the sequence consumer and suspend the execution of sequence() until the next element is
 * requested by the consumer. yield() takes a single element as an argument; yieldAll() can take an Iterable object,
 * an Iterator, or another Sequence. A Sequence argument of yieldAll() can be infinite.
 * However, such a call must be the last: all subsequent calls will never be executed.
